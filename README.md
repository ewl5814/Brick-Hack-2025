# Brick-Hack-2025

## Inspiration Bricks
College students have a lot on their plates.  They have classes, extracurriculars, clubs and homework to juggle, and on top of that they have to make sure they have time to eat. For students living on campus, in dorms especially, meeting daily nutritional requirements can be challenging without access to groceries or a proper cooking space. That's why we came up with nutRITion, an interactive web application that creates food suggestions based on the food options available on-campus.

## What it does
The way it works is simple. Users enter dietary restrictions, requirements, and dining locations into the web page, and a generative AI is used to find breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks that adhere to these constraints.
## How we built it
-Python/sql backend with flask
-Typescript front end with react
-Llama generative AI

## Challenges we ran into
-CSV loading issues
-Input issues with UI
